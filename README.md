# 🧬 About Me 

**C# .NET Developer**, specializing in building desktop (`WPF`) and cross-platform (`.MAUI`) applications, with a focus on algorithms and data management (`MySQL`, `SQLite`).

I help small/medium businesses and startups turn ideas into ready-to-use digital products: from fast `MVPs` to validate hypotheses to full-featured, user-oriented solutions.

## 🧬 My Approach to Work

Working with me, you get not just code but a comprehensive solution:

1. 🔍 **Deep dive into your task:** I start with domain analysis to offer the most effective solution.
2. 🧩 **Clean and maintainable code:** I write code that is easy to scale and hand over, following `Clean Code` principles.
3. 🤝 **Transparency and communication:** You’ll always be informed about the project status. I value open dialogue.
4. 📄 **Detailed documentation:** You’ll receive clear instructions that simplify usage and future support of the product.

I believe that the result of quality work is **clear goal setting** and **mutual interest**. In my projects, I always define objectives and priorities clearly, aligning them with the client.

I enjoy **complex projects** that require deep research – it drives me to **grow** and **become better**, so I can deliver even greater value to my clients.
